    "After graduating with a Higher National Diploma in Software and working within a hospitality organisation for 2 years, I made the decision to pursue a career in Technology. This fascination with tech started long before my GCE in Science and,while considering my options with the hospitality sector, I realised Technology could provide me with so many more op  portunities to nutrure my growth mindset and a love for problem solving.",
